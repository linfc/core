The standard eclipse.exe should not be used. Instead, one should use eclipse.bat
that sets the appropriate environment variables for Sireum.

To pin eclipse.bat in Windows 7, simply first create a shortcut to eclipse.bat 
(and use the icon of launch-eclipse.exe if desired). 

The shortcut should be stored outside of the Sireum/Eclipse directory as it 
might not be kept when Sireum is updated. In addition, if the Sireum directory 
is moved, the shortcut needs to be adjusted appropriately.
